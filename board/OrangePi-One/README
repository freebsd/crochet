Orange Pi One

The Orange Pi One is a single board computer (SBC) based on the
Allwinner H3 system on a chip (SoC) with 512 MB DDR3 RAM.  It has one
10/100 mbit Ethernet, UART, one USB 2.0 host port, one USB 2.0 OTG
port, and one micro SD card slot.  It also has a CSI camera interface
(which I have not tried).  It draws up to 5V/2A power from a barrel
connector.

These boards are very inexpensive (about $10 plus you'll need case and
power cord or power supply).  See orangepi.org for details.

Video over the HDMI does not work due to lack of completed support for
the ARM Mali-400 GPU in FreeBSD.

To build you need FreeBSD source (preferably in /usr/src) and you need
to build the port sysutils/u-boot-orangepi-one.

It is handy to have a USB serial adaptor for degugging since HDMI
doesn't work.

============================================================

Build instructions:

  Get latest source (if you don't already have it).

    ( cd /usr && svn co https://svn.freebsd.org/base/head )
    ( cd /usr && svn co https://svn.freebsd.org/ports/head )

  Build u-boot port.

    ( cd /usr/ports/sysutils/u-boot-orangepi-one && make install )

  Build crochet image.

    sh crochet.sh -v -b OrangePi-One

  Follow directions to use dd to copy an image to micro SD.
