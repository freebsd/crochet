Orange Pi PC Plus

The Orange Pi PC and Orange Pi PC Plus are single board computers
(SBC) based on the Allwinner H3 system on a chip (SoC) with 1 GB DDR3
RAM.  Both have one 10/100 mbit Ethernet, UART, three USB 2.0 port,
one USB 2.0 OTG port, and one micro SD card slot.  The Orange Pi PC
Plus also has 8GB EMMC flash on chip and WiFi with antenna.  Both also
have a CSI camera interface (which I have not tried).  It draws up to
5V/2A power from a barrel connector.

These boards are very inexpensive (about $20-$30 plus you'll need case
and power cord or power supply).  See orangepi.org for details.

Video over the HDMI does not work due to lack of completed support for
the ARM Mali-400 GPU in FreeBSD.

To build you need FreeBSD source (preferably in /usr/src) and you need
to build the port sysutils/u-boot-orangepi-pc-plus.  Use the patch file
in https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=227506 until this
port becomes available (patch from /usr/ports).

It is handy to have a USB serial adaptor for degugging since HDMI
doesn't work.

============================================================

Build instructions:

  Get latest source (if you don't already have it).

    ( cd /usr && svn co https://svn.freebsd.org/base/head )
    ( cd /usr && svn co https://svn.freebsd.org/ports/head )

  Build u-boot port.

    ( cd /usr/ports/sysutils/u-boot-orangepi-pc-plus && make install )

  Build crochet image.

    sh crochet.sh -v -b OrangePi-PC-Plus

  Follow directions to use dd to copy an image to micro SD.

============================================================

Unfortunately, when testing this I was using an Orange Pi PC (not
Plus) so this does work for the PC but may or may not work with the PC
Plus.  Will fix that when I get a PC Plus (fairly soon).
